# dataSangrah

Data Sangrah is your online platform to access data directly in the format available. Most of the data available here are scraped by myself only. In case if the data is from anywhere else, the source of the data will be properly mentioned along with the data.

The word 'Sangrah' is a Sanskrit word which means 'Collection' and hence the the 'Data Sangrah' basically means 'The Collection of Data'. This page is live at <>.

The data that is being scraped by myself may be inconsistent and missing in between. The main reason for this is the unavailability of proper infrastructure and tools to scrape the data. I believe that this inconsistency may also be used in positive way if one is willing to go for it.
